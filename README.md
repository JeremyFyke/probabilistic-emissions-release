# README

This repository tracks code and scripts used to develop CanESM simulations using emission projections sourced from RFF-SP.

Data is available via: https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/~jef000/probabilistic-emissions/v14_production/processed_data/

These scripts are working code associated with analyses in the manuscript "An Earth System Model Ensemble Forced with Probabilistic Emissions: First Demonstration and Prospects for Climate Risk Assessment" (Fyke, Swart and Huard; in review).  If the analysis desribed by these codes is being duplicated, please contact lead author Dr. Jeremy Fyke (jeremy.fyke@ec.gc.ca) for support.
